dumb android game

##### This is just an attempt at programming in java/android.
The game came out quite boring and not so fun to play so don't try to play it.

##### The code is simple because there isn't much of it and that makes this game basic.
It's also not so well optimized as I don't know much about java.
Actually, I don't know anything about it - I've just faked it 'till i made it.

##### it was quite fun to develop it as I haven't struggled much with it.
Most of the time I was fighting with some small bug or with the unknown and wild environment.

##### Here's gameplay screenshot
because you still might be tempted to build it yourself in which case, again, I advise you not to.
